## Code styling

We rely on `Husky` and `Prettier` to meet the code standard. Once you have cloned this repository, run the following commands:

```shell
npm install
npm run prepare
```

This should take care of installing both tool as a `git` hooks which will ensure `prettier` is ran on all files staged for commit.
